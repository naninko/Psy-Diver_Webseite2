The focus is specifically on differences in medication, applied therapies, and treatment success – depending on gender, origin, living situation, or other characteristics. Additionally, patients, relatives and close ones, and healthcare professionals are surveyed so that their experiences and needs are better understood. The goal is psychiatric care that considers all people.",

          title: "Background",
          text: "In psychiatric hospital care, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and psychosocial therapies play a central role. How patients utilize these services and how effective they are depends not only on the illness but also on gender and diversity-related factors. These can create barriers, such as through language problems, cultural differences, reservations about therapies, or social disadvantages. Physical differences can also influence how well medications are tolerated. However, studies systematically examining the utilization and effectiveness of therapies in psychiatric hospitals considering gender, age, origin, or social factors are currently lacking.\n\nAt the same time, diversity-related aspects are becoming increasingly important: New scientific findings show gender-specific factors influencing the effectiveness and tolerability of therapeutic approaches. Demographic and sociocultural changes are leading to an increase in older affected individuals and people with refugee experiences and/or migration backgrounds. Likewise, the number of people with increasingly precarious living conditions such as homelessness is rising. These developments underscore the necessity of needs-based and diversity-sensitive care."

At the same time, personal perspectives are incorporated through qualitative interviews and questionnaires.

Hierzu werden Daten aus einem großen psychiatrischen Klinikverbund mit jährlich rund 50.000 stationären und 170.000 ambulanten Fällen herangezogen. Dabei wird gezielt auf Unterschiede etwa in der Medikation, den angewandten Therapien und dem Behandlungserfolg – je nach Geschlecht, Herkunft, Wohnsituation oder weiteren Merkmalen geschaut. Zusätzlich werden Patientinnen und Patienten, An- und Zugehörigen sowie Fachpersonal befragt, um ihre Erfahrungen und Bedürfnisse besser zu verstehen. Das Ziel ist eine psychiatrische Versorgung, die alle Menschen im Blick hat.",
            para2: "Das Projekt nutzt ein sogenanntes Mixed-Methods-Design. Dabei werden die Auswertungen großer Datenmengen und persönlicher Befragungen kombiniert. Mithilfe von künstlicher Intelligenz werden aus den digitalen Krankenakten zusätzliche Informationen gewonnen. Gleichzeitig fließen über Interviews und Fragebögen persönliche Sichtweisen ein. In einem strukturierten Beteiligungsprozess werden die Ergebnisse schließlich gemeinsam mit Betroffenen und Fachleuten bewertet und Handlungsempfehlungen erarbeitet.",

Zusätzlich werden Betroffene, An- und Zugehörigen und Fachkräfte befragt, damit ihre Erfahrungen und Bedürfnisse besser verstanden werden. Das Projekt integriert Elemente der partizipativen Forschung, bei der Betroffene aktiv einbezogen werden. Nach der Datenauswertung ist das Ziel die gemeinsame Entwicklung von Handlungsempfehlungen für eine geschlechts- und diversitätssensible Gestaltung der psychiatrischen Versorgung.",

          title: "Hintergrund",
          text: "In der psychiatrischen Krankenhausversorgung spielen Pharmakotherapie, Psychotherapie und psychosoziale Therapien eine zentrale Rolle. Wie Betroffene diese Angebote nutzen und wie wirksam sie sind, hängt nicht nur von der Erkrankung ab, sondern auch von geschlechts- und diversitätsbezogenen Faktoren. Diese können Barrieren schaffen, etwa durch Sprachprobleme, kulturelle Unterschiede, Vorbehalte gegenüber Therapien oder soziale Benachteiligungen. Auch körperliche Unterschiede können beeinflussen, wie gut Medikamente vertragen werden. Bisher fehlen jedoch Studien, die die Inanspruchnahme und Wirksamkeit von Therapien in psychiatrischen Krankenhäusern unter Berücksichtigung von Geschlecht, Alter, Herkunft oder sozialen Faktoren systematisch untersuchen.\n\nGleichzeitig werden diversitätsbezogene Aspekte zunehmend wichtiger: Neue wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse zeigen geschlechtsspezifische Einflussfaktoren auf die Wirksamkeit und Verträglichkeit von Therapieverfahren. Demografische und soziokulturelle Veränderungen führen zu einer Zunahme älterer Betroffener und Menschen mit Fluchterfahrung und/oder Migrationshintergrund. Ebenso steigt die Zahl an Menschen mit zunehmend prekären Lebensbedingungen wie Wohnungslosigkeit. Diese Entwicklungen unterstreichen die Notwendigkeit einer bedarfsgerechten und diversitätssensiblen Versorgung."

Das Studiendesign folgt dabei einem partizipativ-generativen Ansatz und zieht Betroffene von psychiatrischen Erkrankungen, aber auch An- und Zugehörigen von Betroffenen und klinische Fachkräfte in Kernentscheidungsbereiche des Projekts mit ein. Mithilfe von künstlicher Intelligenz werden aus den digitalen Krankenakten der neun psychiatrischen Fachklinken des LVR zusätzliche Informationen gewonnen. Gleichzeitig fließen über qualitative Interviews und Fragebögen persönliche Sichtweisen ein. In einem strukturierten Beteiligungsprozess werden die Ergebnisse schließlich gemeinsam mit Betroffenen und Fachleuten bewertet und Handlungsempfehlungen erarbeitet."
